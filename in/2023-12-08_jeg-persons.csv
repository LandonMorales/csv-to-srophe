Since the late 530s, he mainly lived in Constantinople where he enjoyed good relations with Justinian despite his miaphysite convictions. John earned fame with his missionary campaigns in Asia Minor and rose, in 558, to become bishop and one of the miaphysite leaders in Constantinople. John participated in the debates to find a formula of faith that could be accepted by both the miaphysites and the Chalcedonians. He was a victim of the miaphysite persecution starting in 571 and repeatedly imprisoned until his death in about 589. He wrote the Lives of the Eastern Saints, a collection of hagiographic tales, and a large Ecclesiastical History, of which the third part dealing with the events of the 570s and 580s has been preserved.

This view was accepted at the council of Chalcedon in 451, but proved a decisive bone of contention with the supporters of a miaphysite Christology who accused Leo of splitting Christ into two."

Theodosius ordained him patriarch of Antioch in 564, but he never was accepted by all the miaphysites in Syria. Paul's position was further weakened in the early 570s, when he temporarily entered into communion with the Chalcedonians. Eventually, his opponents succeeded in ordaining Peter of Callinicum as counter-patriarch. According to Joh. Eph., EH 4.54-57, Paul spent his last years in hiding and his death went largely unnoticed.

Ousted from his see because the population favoured Gaianus, he was restored with the help of imperial troops. He refused to accept the council of Chalcedon as orthodox and was therefore put in house arrest in Constantinople in late 536. After the death of Severus in 538, he was accepted as the head of the miaphysite community and remained in the capital until his death in 566.

In late 574, he was made Caesar and he became sole emperor after Justin's death in October 578. John of Ephesus portrays Tiberius as the antithesis to Justin, as a tolerant ruler who did not allow the persecution of the miaphysites.	7K28WD3W	1323-1326	574-582	0574-12-07		floruit	7K28WD3W	1323-1326	0582-08-14			death	7K28WD3W	1323-1326	Tiberius	7K28WD3W	PLRE 3	Tiberius Constantinus 1#1323-1326	entry#p	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_II_Constantine
