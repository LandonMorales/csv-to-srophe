He was consecrated, towards the end of the 550s, by Jacob Burd'oyo. Known as the 'apostle of the Arabs', he founded many churches and monasteries and spread miaphysite Christianity in regions that had been traditionally held by the dyophysite Church of the East. In the mid-570s, he was martyred on the orders of Khosrow because he had baptised one of the king's sons. However, Khosrow had been well inclined towards him previously, as is recorded in Joh. Eph., EH 6.20. The king hosted religious disputations between Ahudemmeh and the katholikos of the Church of the East, probably Joseph, and declared Ahudemmeh as the victor.

Probably on imperial orders, Anthimus approached the leading miaphysites of his day, Severus of Antioch and Theodosius of Alexandria. Because of this, opponents started claiming that he had condemned Chalcedon and entered into communion with Severus. Resistance to him grew in Constantinople and his position became untenable when the staunchly Chalcedonian Roman bishop Agapetus visited the capital in March 536. He stepped down as bishop and, together with many other miaphysites, enjoyed the protection of the empress Theodora until her death in 548.	5NKETXXN	I, 733	535-536	0535-06-05	0536-03-13	floruit	5NKETXXN	I, 733		0548-06-28		death	5NKETXXN	I, 733	Anthimus Trapezuntinus	JLMCGNS9	CPG	7085-7088#III, 345-347	entry#p	http://syriaca.org/johnofephesus/persons/1592	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthimus_I_of_Constantinople

An influential theologian, he clashed with Nestorius of Constantinople on the question of whether Mary could be addressed as Theotokos (bearer of God). Cyril ensured that Nestorius and his dyophysite Christology were condemned at the council of Ephesus in 431. In the sixth century, he was seen as a champion of orthodoxy by both miaphysites and Chalcedonians. The emperor Justinian, in his theological writings, sought to ensure that the decisions of the contentious council of Chalcedon were interpreted in line with Cyrillian Christology.

John earned fame with his missionary campaigns in Asia Minor and rose, in 558, to become bishop and one of the miaphysite leaders in Constantinople. John participated in the debates to find a formula of faith that could be accepted by both the miaphysites and the Chalcedonians. He was a victim of the miaphysite persecution starting in 571 and repeatedly imprisoned until his death in about 589. He wrote the Lives of the Eastern Saints, a collection of hagiographic tales, and a large Ecclesiastical History, of which the third part dealing with the events of the 570s and 580s has been preserved.

During his reign, Maurice brought the war with the Sasanians to a successful completion in 591 and restored Roman rule in the Balkan provinces. He was a committed Chalcedonian, yet John of Ephesus is, in his Ecclesiastical History, quite positive towards him since he did not embark on a policy of persecution towards the miaphysites. Maurice was overthrown and murdered after an army mutiny in November 602.	7K28WD3W	855-860	582-602	0582-08-13		floruit	7K28WD3W	855-860	0602-11-27			death	7K28WD3W	855-860	Mauricius	7K28WD3W	PLRE 3	Fl.

Eventually, his opponents succeeded in ordaining Peter of Callinicum as counter-patriarch. According to Joh. Eph., EH 4.54-57, Paul spent his last years in hiding and his death went largely unnoticed.

Eph., EH 4.45. Because of his communion with the Chalcedonians in the early 570s, Paul had lost much of his authority and large parts of the Syrian miaphysites did not recognise him anymore. Peter owed his accession to the episcopal throne to Damian of Alexandria, yet in the mid-580s, the two bishops fell out because of questions related to trinitarian theology. The ensuing schism between the miaphysite sees of Alexandria and Antioch lasted until 616.

According to legend, he was a Roman officer who suffered martyrdom in Rusafa close to the Euphrates in the early 4th century. From the 5th century onwards, his shrine at Rusafa-Sergiopolis became a major cult centre for the Arab tribes, as recorded for instance in Joh. Eph., EH 6.4.

After his conversion in c.490, Severus became actively involved in the fight against the council of Chalcedon and gained much importance during the reign of Anastasius. He became patriarch of Antioch in 512, but was forced to leave his see and go into exile to Egypt after the accession of Justin I in 518. In 535, Justinian invited him to Constantinople for religious discussions to overcome the divide between pro- and anti-Chalcedonians. However, these plans failed and Severus died in his Egyptian exile in 538.

In late 574, he was made Caesar and he became sole emperor after Justin's death in October 578. John of Ephesus portrays Tiberius as the antithesis to Justin, as a tolerant ruler who did not allow the persecution of the miaphysites.	7K28WD3W	1323-1326	574-582	0574-12-07		floruit	7K28WD3W	1323-1326	0582-08-14			death	7K28WD3W	1323-1326	Tiberius	7K28WD3W	PLRE 3	Tiberius Constantinus 1#1323-1326	entry#p	http://syriaca.org/johnofephesus/persons/3268	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_II_Constantine
