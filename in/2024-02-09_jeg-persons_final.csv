John earned fame with his missionary campaigns in Asia Minor and rose, in 558, to become bishop and one of the miaphysite leaders in Constantinople. John participated in the debates to find a formula of faith that could be accepted by both the miaphysites and the Chalcedonians. He was a victim of the miaphysite persecution starting in 571 and repeatedly imprisoned until his death in about 589. He wrote the Lives of the Eastern Saints, a collection of hagiographic tales, and a large Ecclesiastical History, of which the third part dealing with the events of the 570s and 580s has been preserved.

He was originally from the Illyrian prefecture and many Constantinopolitan aristocrats considered him as an illiterate parvenu. At the start of his reign, he changed the imperial religious policy, restored relations with Rome, declared the council of Chalcedon orthodox, and expelled miaphysite bishops such as Severus of Antioch.	6RXKPRGP	648-651	518-527	floruit	0518-07-10		6RXKPRGP	648-651	0527-08-01	death			6RXKPRGP	648-651	Iustinus	6RXKPRGP	Iustinus 4#648-651	entry#p	PLRE 2	http://syriaca.org/johnofephesus/persons/2268	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_I
