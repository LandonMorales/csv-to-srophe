# CSV-to-Srophe

The CSV-to-Srophe application is a set of XQuery modules for converting CSV data to Srophe-compliant TEI XML records. It was developed initially to facilitate Syriaca.org's pipeline for creating new TEI XML data records from CSV sources for deployment on [The Srophe App](https://srophe.app/). 

Please see the [Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/wlpotter/csv-to-srophe/wiki) for instructions and documentation for installing, running, and customizing the application. 

For a step-by-step guide that takes you from installation procedures to running your first transform, please see [Getting Started](https://github.com/wlpotter/csv-to-srophe/wiki/Getting-Started).
